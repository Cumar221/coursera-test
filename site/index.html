<h5>&quot;It’s interesting that if we were to use the “better” bounds of O(m2 log2 C) orO(n3) that we developed in the previous sections, we’d get the inferior running times of O(m2 log n) or O(n3) for this problem. There is nothing contradictoryin this. These bounds were designed to be good for all instances, even when C is very large relative to m and n. But C = n for the Bipartite Matching Problem, and so the cost of this extra sophistication is not needed. It is worthwhile to consider what the augmenting paths mean in the network G and (x5, y5) in the bipartite graph in Figure 7.1; see also Figure 7.10. Let f be the corresponding flow in G a maximum s-t flow, and hence there is an augmenting path in the residual graph G. One such augmenting path is marked in Figure 7.10(b). Note that f the edges (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) are used backward, and all other edges are used forward. All augmenting paths must alternate between edges used backward and forward, as all edges of the graph G go from X to Y. Augmenting paths are therefore also called alternating paths in the context of finding a maximum matching. The effect of this augmentation is to take the edges used backward out of the matching, and replace them with the edges going forward. Because the augmenting path goes from s to t, there is one more forward edge than backward edge; thus the size of the matching increases by one. Consider the matching M consisting of edges (x2, y2), (x3, y3). This is a non&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;space&quot;
